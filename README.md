Mobile test and REST test assignments
## Mobile test
As I have no specification I do not know what is the expected behaviour of the different functions.
I used my common sense which is sometimes probably different what the customer wants.
I took the functions of the buttons reflect on the TEXT on them.
- ADD -> x+1
- SUBTRACT -> x-1
- SQUARE ROOT  -> âˆš(x)
- DIVIDED by 2 ->  x/2
- MULTIPLY by 2  -> x*2
- POWER by 2 -> x^2

where x means the value in the result field.

In my test cases I focused on the simplest functionalities and some edge cases, for example square root on a negative number.
### Automation
  
For all test cases the ADD and SUBTRACT functions are the prerequisit as the base value will be generated using these functions.
* **Test-01 Positive Square Number Square Root**

  I test here a simple square root function on a square number.
  That means that I'm expecting a positive integer as result.
  
* **Test-02 Positive Even Integer Divide**

  I test here a simple divide function on a positiv even integer.
  That means that I'm expecting a positive integer as result.
  
* **Test-03 Positive Integer Myltiply by 2**

  I test here a simple myltiply function on a positive Integer
  That means that I'm expecting a positive even integer as result
  
* **Test-04 Positive Integer Power by 2**
* **Test-05 Negative Square Number Square Root**

Testing the Calculator mobile app, I chose **Robot Framework**.
